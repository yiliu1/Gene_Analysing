# Sparsity   
* Lasso is known to be consistent to recover relevant features when compatibility condition is satisfied.  
* This work is about generalization bound of prediction error of Lasso when designed matrix satisfies 
compatibility condition.   
* I proved that generalization error bound is bounded with Wasserstein distance between new data and training data.  
* Wasserstein distance can be computed explicitly due to regularized optimal transport.
